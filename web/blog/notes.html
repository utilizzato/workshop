            <b>Fact.</b> The polynomials are dense in \( \mathscr{C}([0,1]) \). 
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
            Let \( f\in \mathscr{C}([0,1]) \), and write \( f_{n}(p)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n \choose k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}f\left(\frac{k}{n}\right) \).
            These are polynomials, and we have \( f_n(p) = \mathbf{E}[f(Y)] \) where 
            \( Y=\frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n} \)  with \( X_i \sim B(p) \) independent Bernoulli variables.
            We shall show that \( f_n \longrightarrow f \) uniformly. Firstly, we have 
            \( \lvert f_{n}(p)-f(p) \rvert = \lvert \mathbf{E} [f(Y)-f(p)] \rvert\le\mathbf{E} \lvert f(Y)-f(p) \rvert \).
            Now we fix \( \varepsilon \), and, using uniform continuity, pick \( \delta \) with \( \lvert x-y \rvert \lt \delta\implies \lvert f(x)-f(y) \rvert \lt \varepsilon \).
            We have \( \Pr\left(\delta\le\lvert Y-p\rvert \right)\le\dfrac{\text{var}[Y]}{\delta^{2}}=\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n\delta^{2}}\le \dfrac{1}{4n\delta^{2}} \), 
            and thus \( \lVert f_{n}-f \rVert_{\infty} \le \varepsilon + \frac{2\lVert f\rVert_{\infty}}{4n\delta^2} \le 2\varepsilon \) for all large enough \( n \).

            <b>Fact.</b> Let \(X\) be compact Hausdorff. Then any \(\mathbf{R}\)-subalgebra \(\mathscr{A}\le\mathscr{C}_{\mathbf{R}}(X)\) which separates points is dense.
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
            Without loss of generality let \(\mathscr{A}=\overline{\mathscr{A}}\) be closed. 
            We first claim that \(\mathscr{A}\) is closed under absolute value. 
            Indeed, let \(f\in\mathscr{A}\) and fix a sequence of polynomials \( C_{n}(t)\in\mathscr{R}[t] \) 
            with \( C_{n}(t)\to\lvert t \rvert \) uniformly on \( [-\lVert f \rVert_{\infty}, \lVert f \rVert_{\infty}] \) , 
            so \( \mathscr{A}\ni C_{n}\circ f\to\lvert f \rvert \) uniformly on \(X\). 
            Thus \( \mathscr{A} \) is closed under \( \min \) and \( \max \). 
            Now fix \( F\in\mathscr{C}_{\mathscr{R}}(X) \) and \( \varepsilon \). 
            By separation, for each \( x,y\in X \) we may find \( g_{x,y}\in\mathscr{A} \) with 
            \( g_{x,y}(x)=F(x) \), \( g_{x,y}(y)=F(y) \). 
            We consider the neighborhoods \( U_{x,y}=\left\{ g_{x,y} \lt F+\varepsilon\right\} \). 
            Now, for each \(x\), we may find a finite subcover \( X=U_{x,y_{1}}\cup\dots\cup U_{x,y_{n(x)}} \) 
            and set \( f_{x}=\min(g_{x,y_{1}},\dots,g_{x,y_{n(x)}}) \)
            so that \( f_{x}\in\mathscr{A}, f_{x} \lt F+\varepsilon \), and \( f_{x}(x)=F(x) \). 
            Now we consider the neighborhoods \( V_{x}=\left\{ F-\varepsilon \lt f_{x}\right\} \), 
            and find a finite subcover \( X=V_{x_{1}}\cup\dots\cup V_{x_{m}} \). 
            Then \( f=\max(f_{x_{1}},\dots,f_{x_{m}})\in\mathscr{A} \) has \(\lVert {f-F}\rVert_{\infty}\le\varepsilon\).

            <b>Fact.</b> \(2^S\) has the same ideals as a poset and as a ring.

            We also have a dual notion: <br>
            <b>Nomenclature.</b> Let \(P\) be a poset. A <em>filter</em> \(F\) of \(P\) is a non-empty subset satisfying: <br>
            i. \(\forall y\in P\), \(x\in F\), \(x\le y \implies y\in F\), that is \(F\) is <em>closed upwards</em>. <br>

            <br><br>

            <b>Nomenclature.</b> A <em>filter</em> on a set \(S\) is a filter of \(2^S\). 
            Namely it is a family of subsets \(\mathscr{F}\subseteq 2^S\) satisfying: <br>
            \(S\in\mathscr{F}\). <br>
            \(\forall A,B\in\mathscr{F}\), \(A\cap B\in\mathscr{F}\). <br>
            \(\forall A\in\mathscr{F},B\in 2^S\), \(A\subseteq B \implies B\in\mathscr{F}\).
            <br><br>

            One may think of the sets in the filter \(\mathscr{F}\) as <em>sufficiently large</em>.
            <br><br>

            <b>Examples.</b> The family of all cofinite sets in \(S\) is a filter. <br>
            For fixed \(C\subseteq S\), the family of all subsets containing \(C\) is a filter.
            <br><br>

            Clearly, a filter \(\mathscr{F}\) is proper iff \(\varnothing\not\in\mathscr{F}\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Nomenclature.</b> An <em>ultrafilter</em> is a maximal proper filter.
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> Any proper filter on \(S\) is contained in some ultrafilter.
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> A proper filter \(\mathscr{F}\) on \(S\) is an ultrafilter iff it satisfies:
            \(\forall A\subseteq S\), precisely one of \(A,S\setminus A\) is in \(\mathscr{F}\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> If \(S\) is infinite, then there exists an ultrafilter on \(S\) containing no finite subsets.
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> If \(\mathscr{F}\) is an ultrafilter on \(S\) and 
            \(\bigsqcup_{i=1}^{n}A_i=S\) is a finite partition of \(S\), 
            then precisely one of the parts \(A_i\) is in \(\mathscr{F}\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> Let \(\mathscr{A}\subseteq 2^S\) be a family of subsets. Then the minimal 
            filter containing \(\mathscr{A}\) is the family of all supersets of all finite intersections of sets in \(\mathscr{A}\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Nomenclature.</b> Let \(\mathscr{F}\) be a filter on \(X\) and \(f:X\to Y\) a function. 
            The <em>pushforward</em> of \(\mathscr{F}\) along \(f\) is \(f_*\mathscr{F}=\{B\subseteq Y: f^{-1}(B)\in\mathscr{F}\} \).

            <br><br>

            Recall that for a topological space \(X\), we say that a sequence \(f:\mathbf{N}\to X\) converges to a point \(x\in X\) 
            if for each neighbourhood \(U\) of \(x\) contains all but finitely many values of \(f\). This can be thought of as a special case of the 
            following definition.
            <br><br>

            <b>Nomenclature.</b> Let \(\mathscr{F}\) be a filter on a topological space \(X\). We say that \(\mathscr{F}\) <em>converges</em> to 
            a point \(x\in X\) and write \(\mathscr{F}\longrightarrow x\) if each neighbourhood \(U\) of \(x\) is in \(\mathscr{F}\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> For \(A\subseteq X\) and \(x\in X\) we have that \(x\in\overline{A}\) iff \(\mathscr{F}\longrightarrow x\) 
            for some proper filter \(\mathscr{F}\) containing \(A\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> A function is continuous iff it preserves ultrafilter convergence.
            <br><br>

            <b>Fact.</b> A space \(X\) is compact iff each ultrafilter on \(X\) converges to at least one point.
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
            In the first direction, let \(\mathscr{F}\) be an ultrafilter on a compact space \(X\). 
            Then \(\bigcap_{A\in\mathscr{F}} \overline{A}\) is non-empty, so fix \(x\) in it. Then each 
            neighbourhood \(U\) of \(x\) intersects each \(A\in\mathscr{F}\), 
            and so \(X\setminus U\not\in \mathscr{F}\) giving \(U\in \mathscr{F}\) and \(\mathscr{F}\longrightarrow x\).
            In the other direction, suppose that \((C_i)_{i\in I}\) is a collection of closed subsets of \(X\) 
            having no empty finite intersection. We need to show that \(\bigcap_{i\in I}C_i\) is non-empty. 
            Now, there is an ultrafilter \(\mathscr{F}\) containing all the \(C_i\). 
            By assumption, \(\mathscr{F}\longrightarrow x\) for some \(x\in X\). Now for each neighbourhood \(U\) of \(x\) 
            we have that \(U\in \mathscr{F}\implies U\not\subseteq X\setminus C_i\implies U \) intersects \(C_i\) so 
            \(x\in\overline{C_i}=C_i\) for each \(i\) and \(\bigcap_{i\in I}C_i\) is non-empty, as we wanted.
            <div class="qed">◼</div>
            </details> <br>

            <b>Fact.</b> Let \((X_i)_i\) be spaces, \(X=\prod_i X_i\) their product, \(x=(x_i)_{i} \in X\) a point, 
            and \(\mathscr{F}\) a filter on \(X\). 
            Then \(\mathscr{F}\longrightarrow x\) iff \((\pi_{i})_{*}\mathscr{F}\longrightarrow x_i\) for all \(i\).

            <h2>The Fourier Transform</h2>
            <b>Nomenclature.</b> The <em>Fourier transform</em> of \(f\in L^1(\mathbf{R}^d)\) is 
            \( (\mathcal{F}f)(\xi) = \widehat{f}(\xi) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} f(x) e^{-2\pi i \xi \cdot x} \text{d}x \)
            <br><br>

            <b>Examples.</b> 
            Rectangle: \(\mathcal{F}\left(1_{x\in[-1,1]}\right)(\xi) = \frac{\sin(2\pi\xi)}{\pi \xi}\) <br>
            Triangle: \(\mathcal{F}\left((1-\lvert x\rvert)\cdot 1_{x\in[-1,1]}\right)(\xi) = \frac{1-\cos(2\pi\xi)}{2\pi^2 \xi^2}\) <br>
            \(\widehat{e^{-\lvert x\rvert}} = \frac{2}{1+4\pi^2\xi^2}\) <br>
            The Gaussian is its own Fourier transform: \(\widehat{e^{-\pi x^2}} = e^{-\pi \xi^2}\).
            <br><br>

            <b>Facts.</b> For each \(f\in L^1(\mathbf{R}^d)\), we have the following: <br>
            i. \(\widehat{f}\in\mathscr{C}_0(\mathbf{R}^d)\) is a continuous function vanishing at infinity, 
            and \(\lVert \widehat{f}\rVert_\infty \le \lVert f \rVert_1\). 
            That is, \(\mathcal{F}:L^1\longrightarrow \mathscr{C}_0\) is a bounded linear operator. <br>
            ii. \(\widehat{f}(0) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d}f(x)\text{d}x\) <br>
            iii. \(\mathcal{F}\left(f(x+c)\right)(\xi)=e^{2\pi i c\cdot \xi}\cdot\mathcal{F}\left(f\right)(\xi)\) <br>
            iv. \(\mathcal{F}\left(e^{2\pi i x\cdot c}\cdot f(x)\right)(\xi)=\mathcal{F}\left(f\right)(\xi-c)\) <br>

            vi. \(\mathcal{F}(\overline{f})(\xi) = \overline{(\mathcal{F}f)(-\xi)}\)
            <br><br>

            Deriving under the integral sign and integrating by parts, Leibniz would suggest \((\star)\):
            $$ \partial^\alpha \left(\mathcal{F}(f)\right) = \mathcal{F}\left((-2\pi i x)^\alpha f\right) $$
            $$ \mathcal{F}(\partial^\alpha f) = \left(2\pi i \xi \right)^\alpha \mathcal{F}(f) $$
            for each multi-index \(\alpha\). <br>
            Fubini would suggest \((\diamond)\):
            $$ \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} \widehat{f}(\xi)g(\xi)\text{d}\xi = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} f(x)\widehat{g}(x)\text{d}x $$
            Of course, this only has meaning for a subclass of functions \(f,g\).

            <b>Nomenclature.</b> The <em>Schwartz space</em> \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{R}^d)\) is the

            and all its derivatives decay at \(\infty\) faster than any polynomial grows to \(\infty\), 
            namely such that \(x^\alpha (\partial^\beta f)(x)\) is bounded for each pair of multi-indices \(\alpha,\beta\).

            $$ f(x) = \int_{\mathbf{R}^d} \widehat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i x\cdot \xi}\text{d}\xi $$

            <details>

            That \(\mathcal{F}\) takes Schwartz space into itself follows by \((\star)\), as we have

            \sum_{n\ge 0} q^{n}d(x,Tx)=\frac{d(x,Tx)}{1-q}\lt \infty\),
            and thus \(T^n x\) is Cauchy and hence convergent to some \(y\in M\). Now \(T\) is 
            continuous so \(T^nx\longrightarrow y\implies T^{n+1}x\longrightarrow Ty\), and by 
            uniqueness of limits \(y=Ty\) is a fixed point. However, since \(T\) is a strict 
            contraction, there can't be two distinct fixed points.

            <b>Fact.</b> Let \(M\) be a metric space. Then the following are equivalent: <br>
            i. \(M\) is sequentially compact. <br>
            ii. \(M\) is complete and totally bounded. <br>
            iii. \(M\) is compact. <br>
            iv. Any decreasing chain of non-empty closed sets has a non-empty intersection.

            <summary><b>Proof sketch.</b></summary>
            i \(\implies\) ii and iii \(\implies\) iv are simple. <br>
            ii \(\implies\) iii: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(U_i\) 
            is an open cover of \(M\) without a finite subcover. By total boundedness, 
            we may pick \(x_1\in M\) with the property that no finite subfamily of 
            \((U_i)_{i\in I}\) covers \(B_{2^{-1}}(x_1)\). Continuing, we may pick \(x_n\in M\) 
            with \(B_{2^{-(n-1)}}(x_{n-1})\cap B_{2^{-n}}(x_n)\neq\varnothing\) and with the 
            property that no finite subfamily of \((U_i)_{i\in I}\) covers \(B_{2^{-n}}(x_n)\).
            Thus \(d(x_{n-1},x_n)\le \frac{4}{2^n}\) so \(x_n\) is Cauchy and thus converges to 
            some \(x^*\). Now we have \(B_{\varepsilon^*}(x^*)\subseteq U_{i^*}\), but for large 
            enough \(n\) we have \(B_{2^{-n}}(x_{n})\subseteq B_{\varepsilon^*}(x^*)\), 
            a contradiction. <br>
            iv \(\implies\) i: Let \((x_n)_{n\ge 1}\) be given, and set 
            \(C_n = \overline{\{x_{n},x_{n+1},\dots\}} \). Then \(C_n\) is a decreasing chain of 
            non-empty closed sets, so has a non-empty intersection, and any 
            \(x\in\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty C_n\) is a limit of some subsequence of \((x_n)\).

            <b>Fact.</b> Let \(M\) be a compact metric space and \(\left(U_i\right)_{i\in I}\) an

            Suppose for the sake of contradiction there's no such \(\delta\). Then for each 
            \(n\ge 1\) we may pick \(x_n\in M\) with \(B_{n^{-1}}(x_n)\) not contained in any 
            \(U_i\). Let \(x_{n_k}\longrightarrow x^*\) be a convergent subsequence. Now let 
            \(B_{\varepsilon^*}(x^*)\subseteq U_{i^*}\). Then for large enough \(k\) we have 
            \(B_{n_k^{-1}}(x_{n_k})\subseteq B_{\varepsilon^*}(x^*)\), a contradiction.

            <b>Fact.</b> A continuous map between metric spaces with compact domain is uniformly 
            continuous.
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
            Let \(f:M\to M'\) be a continuous map between metric spaces and suppose \(M\) is 
            compact. We wish to show that \(f\) is uniformly continuous. Indeed, suppose for the 
            sake of contradiction that \(\varepsilon^* \gt 0\) is such that \(\forall n\ge 1\) 
            there are \(x_n, y_n\in M\) with \(d(x_n,y_n)\le n^{-1}\) and 
            \(d'(f(x_n), f(y_n))\ge \varepsilon^*\). Since \(M\) is compact, there is a convergent 
            subsequence \(x_{n_k}\longrightarrow x^*\). Clearly then 
            \(y_{n_k}\longrightarrow x^*\) and by continuity of \(f\) at \(x^*\) we have that 
            \(d'(f(x_{n_k}), f(y_{n_k}))\longrightarrow 0\), a contradiction.

            <b>Fact.</b> In a complete metric space, a countable intersection of dense open sets 
            is dense.
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
            Let \(U_n\) be open dense subsets, and let \(W\) be non-empty open. We wish to show 
            that \(W\) intersects \(\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty U_n\). We start by picking 
            \(\overline{B_{r_1}(x_1)}\subseteq W\cap U_1\). Continuing, we pick 
            \(\overline{B_{r_n}(x_n)}\subseteq B_{r_{n-1}}(x_{n-1})\cap U_n\).
            We may assume \(r_n\le n^{-1}\). Now we have \(x_n\in B_{r_m}(x_m)\) for \(n\ge m\) 
            and so \(x_n\) is Cauchy and hence has a limit \(x\), and 
            \(x\in \overline{B_{r_m}(x_m)}\) for each \(m\), and thus 
            \(x\in W\cap \bigcap_{m=1}^\infty U_m\).

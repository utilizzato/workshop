            <b>Problem.</b> Let \(m\) affine hyperplanes in general position be given in Euclidean 
            \(d\)-dimensional space. Determine the number of regions they devide the space into.
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Solution.</b></summary>
            Let \(R_{m,d}\) denote the answer. Clearly \(R_{m,1}=m+1\). To determine \(R_{m,2}\), we count the 
            number of new regions formed by the \(m\)-th line \(R_{m,2}-R_{m-1,2}\). Each region we had in the last 
            step either remained intact or was split in two by the \(m\)-th line. This number of regions is 
            precisely the number of regions that the \(m\)-th line is now divided into, i.e. \(R_{m-1,1}=m\). Thus 
            \(R_{m,2}={m\choose 2}+m+1\). The same argument applies in all dimensions, and we have 
            \(R_{m,d}=\sum_{j=0}^{d}{m\choose j}\).

            <br>
            i. The origin does not belong to the convex hull of \(p_1,\dots,p_m\). <br>
            ii. There exists a half-sphere containing \(p_1,\dots,p_m\). <br>
            iii. The half-spheres centered at \(p_1,\dots,p_m\) all intersect. <br>
            iv. The half-spheres centered at \(p_1,\dots,p_m\) do not cover the unit sphere. <br>
            v. The polyhedron \(\{x\in\mathbf{R}^d:x\cdot p_j\le1, j=1,\dots,m\}\) is unbounded.

            <summary><b>Solution.</b></summary>
            For \(d=1\) we clealry have \(p_{m,1}=\frac{1}{2^{m-1}}\). The case \(d=2\) is already interesting, and 
            may be solved as follows. For each point \(p\) in the unit circle, we consider the half-circle \(J_p\) 
            going counterclockwise from \(p\) to its antipodal point. Let \(A_i\) denote the event that \(J_{p_i}\) 
            contains \(p_1,\dots,p_m\). Then it's easy to see that the \(A_i\) are disjoint and their union is the 
            desired event. Clearly \(\text{Pr}(A_i)=\frac{1}{2^{m-1}}\), so \(p_{m,2}=\frac{m}{2^{m-1}}\). The idea 
            for the next dimensions will be not to generate the random points \(p_1,\dots,p_m\) but instead to 
            first generate random antipodal point pairs \(\pm p_1,\dots,\pm p_m\), and then count the number of 
            sign combinations contributng to our event. Now, the point pair \(\pm p\) is equivalent to the 
            splitting of the sphere into the two half-spheres centered at \(\pm p\), so we have \(m\) random such 
            splits, and we're interested in the number of choices of half-spheres that all intersect, i.e. in the 
            number of regions we've devide the sphere into. This number, \(S_{m,d}\), is independent of the random 
            choices of antipodal pairs, and similarly to before we have \(S_{m,d}=2R_{m-1,d-1}\). Thus 
            \(p_{m,d}=\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}{m-1\choose j}}{2^{m-1}}\).

            <b>Problem.</b> Let \(X\) denote the number of points drawn from a sphere until their convex hull 
            contains the sphere's center. Determine \(\mathbf{E}[X]\) and \(\text{Var}[X]\). 
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Solution.</b></summary>
            We have \(\text{Pr}(X>m)=p_{m,d}\) so 
            \(\mathbf{E}[X]=\)
            \(1+\sum_{m\ge 1}p_{m,d}=\)
            \(1+\sum_{j=0}^{d-1}\sum_{m\ge1}\frac{{m-1\choose j}}{2^{m-1}}\). Now we recall that 
            \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {n\choose k}x^n=\frac{x^k}{(1-x)^{k+1}}\) so finally 
            \(\mathbf{E}[X]=2d+1\). <br>
            The variance calculation is similar, 
            \(\mathbf{E}[X^2]=1+\sum_{m\ge1}(2m+1)p_{m,d}\) yields \(\text{Var}[X]=2d\).

            Fix \( p,q\in\mathbf{Z}^{d} \). Consider the lazy symmetric random walks \( X_{n},Y_{n} \) in 
            \( \mathbf{Z}^{d} \) starting respectively at \( p,q \), and evolving as follows. Each time we draw a 
            random step \( s=\pm e_{i} \). If \( X_{n},Y_{n}\) agree in the \(i\)-th coordinate, we draw a coin to 
            decide if whether both walks take the step \(s\), or both stay in place. If \( X_{n},Y_{n}\) disagree 
            in the \(i\)-th coordinate, we draw a coin to decide which of the walks takes the step \(s\), with the 
            other staying in place. Since \(\mathbf{Z}\) is recurrent, we have \(\lim_{n}\Pr(X_{n}=Y_{n})=1\). Thus

            <h2>Stochastic Dodgeball</h2>
            Joint with Haran Pilpel. 
            <br><br>

            We consider the following stochastic model for the game of dodgeball, raised by Yoav Katz and Reem 
            Waxman: 
            <br><br>
            
            <b>Game description.</b> There are \( n \) players, initally all <em>free</em>. The game ends when only 
            one free player remains. Until then, at each turn, two free players \( A \) and \( B \) are chosen at 
            random and \( A \) <em>captures</em> \( B\), leading to all of \( B \)'s captives to become free (and 
            rejoin the game). 
            <br><br>
            
            We are interested in the game's expected number of turns. By disregarding the identities of the 
            players, we may represent a state of the game simply as a partition of \( n \). Namely, if there are 
            \( \ell \) free players, then the partition has \( \ell \) parts of sizes corresponding to the number 
            of captives each free player holds (plus one to account for the free player). To get a feeling for the 
            game, the reader is instructed to determine the Markov chain representing the game for \( n= 4\), where 
            there are only five states.
            <br><br>

            <b>Theorem.</b> For \( \lambda = (\lambda_1,\dots) \)  a partition of \( n\) representing a starting 
            state of the game, the expected number of turns for the game to end equals 
            \( 2^{n-1}-1-\sum_{j}(2^{\lambda_{j}-1}-1) \). In particular, for the starting state where all the 
            \( n\)  players are free, the game's expected lifetime is \( 2^{n-1}-1\)  turns. 
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary>
            Let \( E(\lambda) \) denote the expected number of turns for the game to end, and 
            \( F(\lambda) = 2^{n-1}-1-\sum_{j}(2^{\lambda_{j}-1}-1) \). As long as \(\lambda\) is not the terminal 
            state \((n)\), suppose two free players \(a,b\)  are chosen, and let \(\lambda^{ab}\) and 
            \(\lambda^{ba}\) be the new states depending on whether \(a\) captures \(b\)  or \(b\) captures \(a\). 
            Then we have \(\dfrac{F(\lambda^{ab})+F(\lambda^{ba})}{2}=F(\lambda)-1\). In particular, if 
            \(\lambda'\)  represents the (random) state following \(\lambda\), then 
            \(\mathbf{E}F(\lambda')=F(\lambda)-1\). The only functions satisfying this condition are those of the 
            form \(F(\lambda)=E(\lambda)+c\), where \(c\)  is some constant. But \(F(\lambda)\) and 
            \(E(\lambda)\)  both vanish on the terminal state \((n)\), and so \(F(\lambda)=E(\lambda)\) as claimed. <div class="qed">◼</div>
            <br><br>

            The proof shows, in fact, that the distribution with which we choose the pair \(\{A,B\}\) of free 
            players to compete for each turn has no influence on the expected number of turns for the game to end 
            (even though it completely changes the Markov chain describing the game), as long as the odds of \(A\) 
            capturing \(B\) and those of \(B\) capturing \(A\) are the same.

            The first problem on the second day of Iran's 2014 team selection test for the international

            <b>Problem.</b> Consider a tree with \(n\) vertices labeled \(1,\dots,n\). By 
            <em>acting</em> on an edge we mean swapping the labels of its endpoints. By acting once on each edge, 
            in some order of the edges, we create a permutation of the labels. Show that this permutation is a full 
            \(n\) cycle. <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Solution.</b></summary> 
            By induction on the tree, for example by considering the last edge acted upon.
            </details> <br>

            We are interested in the number of possible permutations achievable through the above process. To get a 
            feeling for the problem, the reader is instructed to work out the cases of a star and some small paths. <br><br>

            <b>Theorem.</b> Let \(T\) be a tree on \(n\) vertices labeled \(1,\dots,n\). For each 
            enumeration of the \(n-1\) edges of \(T\), we form a permutation of \(1,\dots,n\) by sequentially 
            swapping the labels of the endpoints of each edge. The number of distinct permutations thus formed is 
            equal to \(\prod_v d_v!\), where \(d_v\) is the degree of vertex \(v\) in \(T\). 
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary> 
            Suppose that for each vertex \(v\), we are supplied with the order by which we acted on the \(d_v\) 
            edges meeting \(v\). Then we may construct the output permutation as follows: for each vertex \(v_1\), 
            let \(v_1v_2\) be the first edge meeting \(v_1\) on which we acted, let \(v_2v_3\) be the first edge 
            meeting \(v_2\) on which we acted after acting on \(v_1v_2\), and so on, until \(v_{r-1}v_{r}\) was the 
            last edge meeting \(v_{r}\) on which we acted. Then \(v_1\) is mapped to \(v_r\) by the permutation, 
            and since \(v_1\) was generic we may indeed construct the output permutation. On the other hand, 
            suppose that we are supplied with the output permutation (for some enumeration of the edges). Then we 
            may determine, for each vertex \(v\), the order by which we acted on the \(d_v\) edges meeting \(v\). 
            To see this, let \(r=d_v\), let \(e_1,\dots,e_r\) be the edges meeting \(v\) by the ordering in which 
            we act on them, let \(T_1,\dots,T_r\) be the trees of \(T-v\), and \(e_i=vw_i\) with \(w_i\in T_i\). 
            Then \(v\) is mapped by the permutation inside \(T_1\), all of \(T_1\)'s vertices are kept inside 
            \(T_1\) except for one which maps to \(T_2\), all of \(T_2\)'s vertices are kept inside \(T_2\), except 
            for one which maps to \(T_3\) and so on, until lastly all of \(T_r\)'s vertices are kept inside 
            \(T_r\), except for one which maps to \(v\). So, the order \(e_1,\dots,e_r\) may indeed be determined 
            by the output permutation. It follows from the above bijection that the number of feasible outcome 
            permutations is equal to \(\prod_v d_v!\) as claimed. <div class="qed">◼</div>
            </details> <br>

            In fact, we have a criterion for feasibility of a permutation. <br><br>

            <b>Theorem.</b> 
            Let \(T\) be a tree on \(n\) vertices labeled \(1,\dots,n\). Then a permutation of \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) is 
            feasible (namely can be formed by swapping the labels of the endpoints of each edge of \(T\) in some 
            order) if, and only if, for each vertex \(v\) there is an enumeration \(T_1,\dots,T_r\) of the trees of 
            \(T-v\) (for \(r=d_v\)) such that \(v\) is mapped inside \(T_1\), all of \(T_1\)'s vertices are kept 
            inside \(T_1\) except for one which maps to \(T_2\), and so on, until lastly all of \(T_r\)'s vertices 
            are kept inside \(T_r\) except for one which maps to \(v\).
            <br><br>

            <details>
            <summary><b>Proof.</b></summary> 
            As noted above, necessity follows by considering the order by which we acted on the edges meeting 
            \(v\). For sufficiency, let \(\pi\) be a permutation which satisfies the above property. For each 
            vertex \(v\), we consider the first edge in the path from \(v\) to \(\pi(v)\). By the pigeonhole 
            principle, we have an edge \(vw\) specified by both \(v\) and \(w\). Finding such an edge, we swap it 
            first. We see that for the two trees formed by removing this edge, the relabeling that remains to 
            perform on each of them also satisfies the above property, and so by recursion we may continue and 
            construct a sequence of edge swaps forming \(\pi\).
